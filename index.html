          <h3>Bubble Gum Invention</h3>
          <p>
            On December 28, 1869, the first-ever successful chewing gum was
            created by William Finley Semple. The gum would then be sold in
            vending machines across New York as a great success. This would mark
            the steppingstone for the creation of bubble gum. In 1906, the first
            invention of bubble gum was created by Frank H. Fleer, labeled
            “Blibber-Blubber,” except it was not sold publicly. Shortly after,
            in 1913, Fleer made the Frank H. Fleer Corporation labeled a gum
            manufacturer. The company would continue to produce regular chewing
            gum until an accountant at the company named Walter Diemer would
            make a great discovery.
          </p>

          <p>
            During his spare time, Diemer would often experiment with recipes.
            He formed a pink, less sticky gum that allowed bubbles to be blown
            because of the new texture. He packaged one hundred pieces of the
            treat and attempted to sell his inventory in a local candy store.
            Surprisingly, the gum sold out after a single day and can be
            considered a hit. With the help of Fleer, this new creation would be
            marketed and sold under what we know today as the famous “Dubble
            Bubble”!.

              <h3>Bubble Gum Flavor</h3>
              <p>
                When you chew bubble gum, a sweet sensation is released to your
                taste buds. However, the flavor is not directly comparable to
                the other likes on the market. This is because bubble gum
                combines many fruity flavors, such as strawberry, banana, and
                cherry. By mixing different tastes, bubble gum is given its
                staple fruity flavor. This flavor is enjoyed by many people
                around the world and can be found in sweets such as ice cream,
                sodas and more. In addition, you can also find bubble gum
                flavored floss sticks and toothpaste to keep your teeth clean
                while enjoying the same classic taste.

              <h3>Bubble Gum Smell</h3>
              <p>
                The smell of bubble gum happens to be very popular and liked by
                many people. Because of this, companies have launched products
                aimed to mimic the fragrance of bubble gum in forms of perfumes
                and oils. The smell is described as “sweet” and “fruity”. It's
                fragrance might smell so good it will make you want to eat it!

          <h3>Bubble Gum Facts:</h3>
          <p>
            Here are some fun facts about bubble gum you can think about the
            next time you start chewing and blowing bubbles:
          </p>
          <ul class="facts">
            <li>
              Walter Diemer claims that his creation of bubble gum was on
              accident when he experimented with new formulas while working in a
              chewing gum factory.
            </li>
            <li>
              The chewing gum is colored pink because it was the only available
              food coloring in the factory at the time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you accidentally swallow bubble gum, it does not stay in your
              digestive system for seven years.
            </li>
            <li>The most giant bubble ever blown was 23 inches in diameter.</li>

        <h2>What’s New & Exciting!</h2>
        <article>
        <h3 id="floating-bubble-gum-exhibit">Floating Bubble Gum Exhibit</h3>
          <p>
            Ever wondered how bubble gum could be incorporated into a piece of
            art? Well, a sculptor named Kim Faler has created just that.
            Kim’s work can be found at Palo Gallery, a building in New York City
            that features many different art pieces in monthly exhibits. Each
            month shows various artists' work and can be viewed for free!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            From February 25th to March 31st, you can physically view the
            “Double Bubble” exhibit. The double bubble has 20 pieces of
            sculptured bubble gum hanging from the ceiling. Each piece of bubble
            gum is uniquely colored and has a different material than others
            such as metal, gypsum, wax, and glass.
          </p>

          <p class="quote">
            <i
              >“I see these forms as visual manifestations of our anxiety, and
              an illustration of the tension that we have come to reside with.”
              – Kim Faler 2020</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The bubble gum is purposely placed at the average human eye height allowing someone to connect with Kim’s quote above. Palo Gallery describes the double bubble as a way to explore the anxiety, weight, and manifestations of emotional struggles experienced by the viewer. Bubble gum is soft, chewy, and becomes deformed once you start savoring its flavor but also can be described as relaxing for some. What do you think about the personal connection this artwork gives off to you?
