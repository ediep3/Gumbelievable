            Gumbelievable is proud to announce the first phase of the bubble gum
            blowing contest of 2022! The quarterly bubble gum blowing contest is
            an event that runs every three months, four times a year, referred
            to as a phase. Contestants will compete for rewards based on their
            performance at the end of each phase to score prizes and the chance
            to qualify for our largest competition, “The Big Bubble.”
          </p>

          <hr class="solid" />
          <!------>
          <h3>Phases</h3>
          <p>
            Every year there will be four phases that run for approximately
            three months. Phase 1-3 is open to everyone, while Phase 4 will be a
            closed qualifier based on previous performance in the three phases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each phase, excluding the fourth, is independent of each other,
            meaning results from previous phases will not carry over and is not
            relevant to others in the future. However, your performance/scoring
            will determine if you have accumulated enough points to qualify for
            the fourth phase.
          </p>
          <p class="phases">
            Phase 1: January 1st – March 23rd<br />
            Phase 2: April 1st – June 23rd<br />
            Phase 3: July 1st – September 23rd<br />
            Phase 4: October 8th – December 31st (The Big Bubble)
          </p>

          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <p>
            Contestants will compete against each other during each phase and
            score based on how big their bubble is blown. Measurement will be
            taken in inches using your tool of choice. The contestant must
            provide clear evidence for an entry to be valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with physical prizes, the top 25% of contestants in each phase
            will earn 20 points total, while the top 50% will earn 10 points
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            To qualify for the fourth phase, contestants must have a minimum of
            30 points. Your points will be added up and collected by us at
            Gumbelievable. We will release a list through Facebook and Instagram
            of contestants that qualify for the fourth phase.
          </p>
